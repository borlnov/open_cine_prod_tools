To generate this list, you can call:

```console
> dart pub global run mono_repo readme --pad
```

This will print a markdown table to copy/paste here each time we add or remove a package.

## How to use the packages in your project

To use the libraries in your project, we recommend you to bind this repo as a /actlibs git submodule
in your project.

In the `pubspec.yaml` you will have to link them like this:

```yaml
act_life_cycle:
  git:
    path: actlibs/act_life_cycle
```

For each project which includes those libs, you have to create a branch in this repository and point
on it. This way, you are independent of the others projects but can get improvements or bugs
corrections from others.

Because, this code isn't reviewed if no merge request is done to the master branch, it's recommended
to oftenly create merge requests from the project branch to master.

## Add a new package

To add a new package to actlibs, at the root of `actlibs` folder you can call:

```console
> flutter create --template=package <your_package_name>
```

Then, in the `pubspec.yaml` you will have to set:

```yaml
publish_to: none
```

You will need to create a `mono_pkg.yaml` file with at least the stage: `analyze`.

Then, you will have to call the next command to regenerate the GitHub Actions configuration
(this also re-applies the flutter-version patch):

```console
> tool/mono_repo_generate.sh
```

## Update the GitHub Actions Flutter version

`mono_repo` does not support a global Flutter version, so the version is set in each
`mono_pkg.yaml` file and persisted in `tool/.flutter_version`. Use the script:

```console
> tool/mono_repo_generate.sh --flutter-version <version>
```

Where `<version>` is the Flutter version to target, for example `3.41.9`. It may also be a
channel, for example `stable` or `beta`.

This command updates all `mono_pkg.yaml` files, saves the version to `tool/.flutter_version`,
and regenerates the CI configuration with the appropriate workflow patch.
