## Documentation

Here is a class diagram of the package:

![class diagram](doc/class_diagram.png)

The global idea is the following: The `AbsServerStorageManager` must be implemented and requires a
concrete class which extends the `MixinStorageService` to provide basic storage operation.
The `AbsServerStorageManager` also embeds a `CacheService` which is responsible for caching
some files on the device. We use [this library](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_cache_manager) to
handle the logic of caching files.

To use this package you need to:

- Implement a class which extends the `MixinStorageService` class.
- Create a `ServerStorageManager` class which feeds the `AbsServerStorageManager` with the 
  implementation of the `MixinStorageService` class.
- Use the `ServerStorageManager` to download and cache files.
